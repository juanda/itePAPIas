PAPI AUTHENTICATION SERVER
==========================

This software provides an easy-to-deploy PAPI authentication server.

## Installation

* Get the code. You can directly download from this github repository or 
if you prefer a versioned copy, you can use a git client:

	git clone git@github.com:juandalibaba/itePAPIas.git

* Configure the AS by editing the config.php  file. 

* That's all, now you can access the AS through the following URL:
	
	http(s)://yourdomain/path_to_the_web_directory/index.php/signin

## Notes

It's highly recommended to set the 'web' directory as the document root
of your web server.
